//Using this array :

//let fruits = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"];




//1. Remove the Banana from the array.



//var fruits = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"];

//fruits.shift();

//console.log(fruits);


//2. Sort the array in order.

//var fruits = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"];

//console.log(fruits.sort());

//3. Put “Kiwi” at the end of the array.

//var fruits = ["Apples", "Blueberries", "Oranges"];

//fruits.push('Kiwi');

//console.log(fruits);


//4. Remove “Apples” from the array. Don’t use the same method as in the question 1.

//var fruits = ["Apples", "Blueberries", "Oranges", "Kiwi"];

//fruits.splice(0,1);

//console.log(fruits);



//5. Sort the array in reverse order. (Not alphabetical, but reverse the current Array i.e. [‘a’, ‘c’, ‘b’] becomes [‘b’, ‘c’, ‘a’])

//var fruits = ["Blueberries", "Oranges", "Kiwi"];

//fruits.reverse();

//console.log(fruits);

//Access array element


//let moreFruits = ["Banana", ["Apples", ["Oranges"], "Blueberries"]];



//console.log(moreFruits[1][1][0]);
