				<h2>The lions</h2>
				<hr>
					<p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense forests.</p>
					<p>It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at twilight.</p>
					<p>A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs.</p>
					<p>Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability.</p>
					<p>Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe</p>
